# Onset-Detection
AVP Portfolio 3<br>
This patch gives information about when a particular sound has occurred.<br>
Designed with drums in mind, the user is able to select frequency ranges for a kick drum and hihat (or other high frequency instrument)<br>
The threshold of detection can also be edited using the corresponding sliders.<br>
The top graph shows the current and previous spectra, while the bottom shows the Spectral Flux.<br>
When a hit is detected, the graph changes in colour to green.
